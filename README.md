Cloid
=====
Cloid is an Android showcase application that interacts with the Azure cloud.

Specifically, the application supports the following features:

- upload images from the Android Gallery to Azure Blob storage
- browse the cloud's list of contents
- download images from Azure Blob storage
- delete images stored in the cloud

Besides 'pull' device-to-cloud communications, the application is also push-enabled (GCM client) 
for cloud-to-device 'push' notifications.
